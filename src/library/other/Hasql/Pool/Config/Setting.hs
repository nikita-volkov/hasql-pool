-- | Maximal connection lifetime.
--
-- Determines how long is available for reuse.
-- After the timeout passes and an active session is finished the connection will be closed releasing a slot in the pool for a fresh connection to be established.
--
-- This is useful as a healthy measure for resetting the server-side caches.

-- 1 day by default.

--
-- Gets used each time a connection gets established by the pool.
-- This may be useful for some authorization models.

-- | Observation handler.
--
-- Typically it's used for monitoring the state of the pool via metrics and logging.
--
-- If the provided action is not lightweight, it's recommended to use intermediate bufferring via channels like TBQueue to avoid occupying the pool management thread for too long.
-- E.g., if the action is @'atomically' . 'writeTBQueue' yourQueue@, then reading from it and processing can be done on a separate thread.
--
-- By default it is:

--
-- Gets executed on every connection upon acquisition.
-- Lets you specify the connection-wide settings.
